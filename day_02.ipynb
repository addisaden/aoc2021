    "It seems like the submarine can take a series of commands like `forward 1`, `down 2`, or `up 3`:\n",

    "* ´forward X´ increases the horizontal position by ´X´ units.\n",
    "* ´down X´ increases the depth by X units.\n",
    "* ´up X´ decreases the depth by X units.\n",

    "Note that since you're on a submarine, down and up affect your depth, and so they have the opposite result of what you might expect.\n",

    "The submarine seems to already have a planned course (your puzzle input). You should probably figure out where it's going. For example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "forward 5\n",
    "down 5\n",
    "forward 8\n",
    "up 3\n",
    "down 8\n",
    "forward 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your horizontal position and depth both start at 0. The steps above would then modify them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ´forward 5´ adds ´5´ to your horizontal position, a total of ´5´.\n",
    "* ´down 5´ adds ´5´ to your depth, resulting in a value of ´5´.\n",
    "* ´forward 8´ adds ´8´ to your horizontal position, a total of ´13´.\n",
    "* ´up 3´ decreases your depth by ´3´, resulting in a value of ´2´.\n",
    "* ´down 8´ adds ´8´ to your depth, resulting in a value of ´10´.\n",
    "* ´forward 2´ adds ´2´ to your horizontal position, a total of ´15´.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of ´15´ and a depth of ´10´. (Multiplying these together produces ´150´.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. *What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?*"
